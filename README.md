# CSharpCodeSnippets
A collection of useful C# code snippets to boost productivity.

## Getting Started

Code snippets are useful tools provided by Visual Studio. There are several of them pre-installed. Eg. type `propfull` in the code window then hit tab two times, so the full property creation code snippet activates. After that, you just change the placeholder name(s) in the snippets, and your property will be created together with its backing field.

You can check your code snippets using `Tools`->`Code Snippets Manager`, and you can add your own ones as well.

### Prerequisites

You need Visual Studio to test these snippets.

### Installing

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Select `Tools`->`Code Snippets Manager`
3. Select the folder named `My Code Snippets`
4. Click on `Import...` and find the `.snippet` file you want to import
5. Click OK, OK
6. Open a C# project

## Testing

Start typing the title of the snippet to activate it

For example:

```
cw
```

Then hit `TAB` twice to see that it has changed to 

```
Console.WriteLine();
```

With the cursor placed in between the two parentheses.
